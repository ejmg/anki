    What is the difference between declarative and imperative languages?
*** Back
    Declarative vs Imperative is the topmost level of distinction between types
    of PLs. 

     - Imperative languages focus on /how/ a computer goes about its instructed
       task.

     - Declarative languages focus on /what/ the computer does.

     Newton’s First Law
**** Back
     In the absence of external forces and when viewed from an inertial
     reference frame, an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion
     continues in motion with a constant velocity (that is, with a constant
     speed in a straight line).
     - In other words, when no force acts on an object, the acceleration of the
       object is zero.
     - The tendency of an object to resist any attempt to change its velocity
       is called inertia.

     Newton’s Second Law
**** Back
     When viewed from an inertial reference frame, the acceleration of an
     object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and
     inversely proportional to its mass:

     $\vec{a} \propto \frac{\Sigma \vec{F}}{m}$

     When a proportionality constant of 1 is chosen, mass, acceleration, and
     force are related via:

     $\Sigma \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$

     - Note, we are discussing the relation of /net force/ with an object’s
       acceleration
     - Newton’s 2nd is easily decomposed into component form:

       $\begin{array}{rcl} \Sigma \vec{F_{x}} & = & ma_{x} \\  \Sigma \vec{F_{y}} & = & ma_{y} \\ \Sigma \vec{F_{z}} & = & ma_{z} \end{array}$

     Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
**** Back
     When work is done on a system and the only change in the system is in its
     speed, the net work done on the system equals the change in kinetic energy
     of the system.

     - furthermore

       The work–kinetic energy theorem indicates that the speed of a system
       increases if the net work done on it is positive because the final
       kinetic energy is greater than the initial kinetic energy. The speed
       decreases if the net work is negative because the final kinetic energy is
       less than the initial kinetic energy.

     Definition of Conservative Force
**** Back
     A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle that is a member
     of the system as the particle moves between two points is independent of
     the path the particle takes between the two points. Furthermore, a force is
     conservative if the work it does on a particle is zero when the particle
     moves through an arbitrary closed path and returns to its initial position.
     A force that does not meet these criteria is said to be nonconservative.

    second stage, then the total procedure can be carried out, in the
    designated procedure, in $mn$ ways.
