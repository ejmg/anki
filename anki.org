*** Front
    What is the difference between declarative and imperative languages?
*** Back
    Declarative vs Imperative is the topmost level of distinction between types
    of PLs. 

     - Imperative languages focus on /how/ a computer goes about its instructed
       task.

     - Declarative languages focus on /what/ the computer does.
