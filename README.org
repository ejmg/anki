* Anki.org

  This really is a work in progress.

  This is a collection of anki cards I've written for myself to study. I use anki-connect and
  anki-editor mode for emacs to write my cards using org-mode. I then export them to anki proper
  where I can study them on desktop and on my phone.

  The cards are in [[file:anki.org][anki.org]].
